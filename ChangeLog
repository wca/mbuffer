20050125:
- fixed operation of low watermark (-p)
- made printf formating more standard conforming
- start output before input thread
- more minor fixes

20050124 (unannounced interims version):
- fixed summary bug reported
- kicked automake
- removed locale support (too much work to support properly)
- changed debugmsg to a C99 macro, if debugging is switched off
- fix: final newline of statusThread was printf()ed to stderr instead 
  of Terminal
- fix: potential incorrect written last block
- fixed warnings: comparison of signed and unsigned
- beautified summary
- added low watermark (request by Greg Freemyer)
  (restarts reading if dropped below - needed for FAST streamers;
   I don't have such a beast and I never expected such a thing to exist...)
  WARNING: changed argument -p to represent low watermark (was high watermark)
           so that both options are easier to remember
- eliminated dead code
- changed status of networking code to stable
- removed NDEBUG from config.h and configure, because assert()s are
  always "a good thing TM"
- encapsulated Terminal I/O within Mutex
- md5 hashing option added (disabled by default, proposal by Greg Freemyer),
  using either mhash or md5 library, whatever is available
- some more cleanups

20011008:
- more detailed errormsg for host name resolving
- beautified some messages
- compile/linker fix

20010807:

- localization added

20010716:
- fixed option -q to not block out usage of multi
  volume support
- docu update
- minor debug message update
- more autoloader sanity checks
- changed status for networking stuff to BETA
  i.e. new configure option "--enable-networking"

20010704:

- added support for autoloaders
- update for experimental networking code
- docu update

20010703:
- update for debug messages

- corrected message for mem-allocation
- added warning message for certain multi-volume use
- enhanced debugging messages
- (hopefully) last bugfix for multi-volume code

20010628:
- added Option -d to use blocksize of output device
  for write (was default behaviour, but isn't needed
  in most cases and slows data transfer down)
- changed statusline (proposal by Dan Hollis)
- minor bugfix for handling read errors (size of
  writable block fragment is now set correctly)
  [probably nobody ever cares anyway]
- updates for experimental networking (configure)

20010626:
- bugfix: mbuffer didn't work anymore with pipes due
  to incorrect set Outsize (0)

20010624:

- bugfix for multivolume-code which might have caused
  problems on devices which have a size which is
  no multiple of Blocksize
- docu update

	  (bugreport by Dan Hollis)
- docu update
- added some extra checks after running lint...

- Docu update concerning usage of multi volume support
- multi volume options consistency checking added

20010509:
- summary is now also displayed upon break and terminate
- Bugfix: summary overflow
- experimental feature: input of multiple volumes

20010507:
- status messages are now printed to the terminal not to stderr
- Bugfix: for output blocksize code
- documentation update
- new: summary information
- experimental feature: output to multiple volumes

20010426:
- Bugfix: fixed sleep, which limited the performace to 1MB/s
          (credits go to Padraig Brady <padraig@antefacto.com>)

- Cosmetic: on sighup print newline on stderr
- added manpage

20010208:
- Bugfix: option -p did not work
