LICENSE:
========
GNU GPL 2 (see COPYING for details)


DESCRIPTION:
============
mbuffer is a raplacement for buffer with additional functionality:

# display of i/o speed
# optional use of memory mapped i/o for huge buffers
# multithreaded instead of sharedmemory ipc
# multi-volume support
# auto-loader support (TEST IT!)
# compatible command-line options
# --? bugs to hunt ?-- :-((


NETWORKING (BETA):
==================
The included networking code is based on TCP and should
therefore be fairly stable out of the box. To use it
you should know the basics of TCP/IP. Use only
on a trusted LAN, as there is no builtin security.
This code is known to not compile on Tru64.
Use configure option --enable-networking to include
this code.


TESTING:
========
to test the program I do the following:
# tar cf - /usr | mbuffer | tar tf - > out
# tar cf - /usr | mbuffer -t | tar tf - > out


ARCHITECTURES:
==============
This software has been tested under the following operatingsystems:
- linux 2.2.x
- linux 2.4.x
- solaris 8
- tru64


64 Bit Buffers:
===============
The buffer limit is 2G x Blocksize. This limit is
caused by the posix semaphore interface which is based on an
int, which is on all architectures a 32 Bit word. So
if you want to use realy huge buffers you need to set a
huge blocksize.


TODO:
=====
# make networking compile under tru64
# fix: warnings for tru64 compilation
# fix: unknown bugs


FEEDBACK:
=========
It is always nice to get feedback. If you encounter
a problem or a bug, send me a note.
