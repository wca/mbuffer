LICENSE:
========
GNU GPL 2 (see COPYING for details)


DESCRIPTION:
============
mbuffer is a raplacement for buffer with additional functionality:

# display of i/o speed
# optional use of memory mapped i/o for huge buffers
# multithreaded instead of sharedmemory ipc
# multi-volume support
# compatible command-line options
# --? bugs to hunt ?-- :-((


INSTALL:
========
To install run
# ./configure
with the options you desire.
To get a list of the possible options, run:
# ./configure --help
HINT: for solaris workstations you need to run:
# ./configure --host sparc-sun-solaris
Then just do a:
# make; make install


EXPERIMENTAL:
=============
This version of mbuffer includes new code which is experimental.
By default this code is not compiled in. If you want to test
it run ./configure --enable-experimental. The code should enable
multi-volume usage on the output stream. Please test it and
send comments and bug reports if you are interested that such
a thing should be included.
(currently no experimental code is included - 
 coming soon: networking code)

In this version there is no experimental code. Soon networking
stuff will be added here...


TESTING:
========
to test the program I do the following:
# tar cf - /usr | mbuffer | tar tf - > out
# tar cf - /usr | mbuffer -t | tar tf - > out


ARCHITECTURES:
==============
This software has been tested under the following operatingsystems:
- linux 2.2.x
- linux 2.4.x
- solaris 8
- tru64


64 Bit Buffers:
===============
The buffer limit is 2G x Blocksize. This limit is
caused by the posix semaphore interface which is based on an
int, which is on all architectures a 32 Bit word. So
if you want to use realy huge buffers you need to set a
huge blocksize.


TODO:
=====
# fix: warnings for tru64 compilation
# fix: unknown bugs


FEEDBACK:
=========
It is always nice to get feedback. If you encounter
a problem or a bug, send me a note.
